# The JS Journey

## This is a tutorial for you to always remember JavaScript 

The app 'Lendo Música' is the way you found for learning the basics of JavaScript using the framework React Native.

### What is Java Script?

JS is not Java! JavaScript is a programming language based on the fundamentals of HTML (hyper text markup language) and CSS (cascade styling sheet) - wich are NOT programming languages.

### What is React and React Native?

Ok, so these are both frameworks, from the developers of facebook, found to be an easier way of coding for web (React) and - here it comes - NATIVE APPs (React Naive)!! That means you don't have to use Android Studio or XCode to build native apps for android or iOs. You can simply use JS + VSCode and there you go - hybrid code on the way =)

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/karenparente/AppLendoMusica/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
