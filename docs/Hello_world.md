# The basics of Java Script

## IDE
The IDE I'm using is *VSCode*. It's the one most of the devs I know use. To donwload & install it, click HERE.

## Compiling and running
I'm using the *Node.js* tool, wich reads, compiles and runs JS files from your terminal.
To download and install it from the APT package manager, simply type on your terminal:
```
sudo apt install nodejs
```

To execute your JS files form their directory, type on your terminal:
```
node FILE_NAME.js
```

## Printing "Hello, world!"

In your app.js file:
```
Console.log("Hello, world!");
```
Then, compile and run it from your terminal :)
